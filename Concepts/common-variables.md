[Back To Contents](../README.md)

| Var    | Def     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| x(n)      | input sequence, where n = the location of the nth sample |
| y(n) | output sequence, where n = the location of the nth sample, also called the difference equation |
| h(n) | signal processing algorithm |
| n | current sample |
| n-1 | previous sample |
| n+1 | next sample |
| z | The delay operator: represents the delay in an algorithm. When z is to a negative exponent - there is a delay in time backwards. When z is to a positive exponents - there is a delay in forward time (not possible in real time processing) |
