## Important Fundamental Digital Signals
* Direct Current (CD) and step (0 Hz)
  * DC is where signal remains 1.0 (hence direct current)
  * For a DC/step, signal changes from 0 to 1.0
* Nyquist - represents the Nyquist frequency
* 1/2 Nyquist - represents 1/2 of the Nyquist Frequency
* 1/4 Nyquist - represents 1/4 of the Nyquist Frequency
* impulse
  * Finite Impulse Response (FIR)
  * Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)
